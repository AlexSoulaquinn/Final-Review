            //1 and 100 that are divisible by both the first parameter and the second parameter to the console window.
            //The main method should call your two methods appropriately.For the ReverseWord, check to see if the word you passed in is equal to the same one that was returned.
            //This is called a palindrome(Links to an external site.).If it is a palindrome, tell the user it is, otherwise tell them the word in reverse.
